# Live Server

## Synopsis

A custom wrapper for @tapio's [live-server package](https://github.com/tapio/live-server).

## Installation

Download this repo's contents, or clone it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dombrant/live-server.git
cd live-server
npm install
npm link
```

Because this package is not hosted on npm, `npm link` must be ran before being able to call it from the command line.

## Usage

From the command line, call:

```bash
$ live-server
```

## Motivation

I've really enjoyed using the `live-server` for development, but I wanted to create a simplified version that I can edit for myself. Specifically, this package displays both the local and remote (from the network's ip address) URLs (inspired by Zeit's [serve](https://github.com/zeit/serve)).
